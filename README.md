A simple, windowed program that displays the basic build of League of Legends champion.

The helper was created for my own use - I did not feel the need to decorate it.
### How to use
Run script, then fill a textbox, and click anywhere on form's body. <b> Attention: </b> the script does not overlay the fullscreen game. It should be runned at the background, or other screen.  
At the <i>name_checker.py</i> you should fill <i>champion_list</i> at the top of block - it is for champion validation.
